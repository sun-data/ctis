Introduction
============

This library aims to provide a unified interface for inverting
images captured by
`computed tomography imaging spectrographs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_imaging_spectrometer>`_
(CTISs), particularly those designed for observing the Sun in extreme
ultraviolet.
